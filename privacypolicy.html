        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 4, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>GooseSupreme</strong> project ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you view repository contents, visit project pages, or interact with project resources. By using our repository or related pages, you agree to the collection and use of information described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> Any data you actively submit to the project (for example, issues, pull requests, comments, contact messages, or form entries on linked project pages).</li>
          <li><strong>Automatically collected information:</strong> Non-identifying technical data (such as IP address, browser type, access times, and server logs) collected by the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) or other third-party services when you access repository pages or assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Operating, maintaining, and improving the project pages, repository, and documentation.</li>
          <li>Responding to issues, pull requests, and community contributions.</li>
          <li>Analyzing usage to improve the project, prioritise features, and fix bugs.</li>
          <li>Communicating important project updates or changes when you choose to provide contact information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not directly set cookies on static repository pages. The platform hosting these pages (for example, GitHub) or any analytics services you encounter via linked pages may use cookies or similar tracking technologies. Please review the privacy and cookie policies of those third-party providers for details.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We rely on third-party services for hosting, continuous integration, package distribution, analytics, and other functions. These services may process or collect data when you interact with linked resources. Each third-party service has its own privacy policy and practices that govern how they use and protect data.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may disclose information when required by law, to respond to legal requests or to protect our rights, safety, or property. Aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify individuals may be shared publicly to help improve the project.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information under our control. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of any information you provide or that third parties collect.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights concerning your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, delete, or export your information. To exercise these rights, please open an issue on the repository or contact the repository owner via the project's GitHub page.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The GooseSupreme project and its repository pages are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date above will indicate when changes were made. Continued use of the project pages after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact</h2>
